        <h1>a quick history about *scene* </h1>
        <p>If you were a teen in the 2000s, chances are you remember the scene subculture—or at least saw flashes of it on Myspace. Scene culture first popped up in the early 2000s in the U.S., branching out from emo, and it quickly became the go-to look and lifestyle for a lot of teens through the mid-2000s and early 2010s. Scene kids—sometimes called scenesters or trendies—had a distinct style: skinny jeans, neon-colored tees, flat-ironed hair with long side bangs, and streaks of bright dye.</p>
        <p>Music was just as important as the fashion. Scene kids blasted metalcore, crunkcore, deathcore, electronic beats, and a healthy dose of pop punk. By the late 2000s, a lot of these genres had moved from underground shows into mainstream playlists, making scene both a style and a soundtrack for a whole generation of teens.</p>
        <p>Like most trends, though, the scene wave eventually faded. By the mid-2010s, its popularity had dropped off, but not before leaving its fingerprints all over internet culture. Tumblr kept the aesthetic alive with its own “scene queens,” and later, some of the musicians who started in scene bands went on to help launch emo rap into the spotlight.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to the late 2010s and 2020s, and scene nostalgia came roaring back. Movements like #20ninescene and the “Rawring 20s” started popping up online, while sites like SpaceHey and FriendProject—throwbacks to the old Myspace days—started gaining traction. On TikTok and Instagram, influencers revived the look with a modern twist, blending scene with e-girl/e-boy fashion and even fueling the rise of hyperpop.</p>
        <p>Scene may not be the same as it was in 2000s, but its influence is still everywhere. Whether it’s in music, online culture, or just the way teens experiment with bold self-expression, scene’s legacy proves it never really died—it just evolved.</p>
